# Railway-Track-Maintenance-Intervals-

Railway tracks are an essential component of transportation systems around the world, and their maintenance is crucial for ensuring safety and reliability. However, traditional methods of track maintenance, which rely on visual inspections and manual measurements, can be time-consuming and costly. This has led to an increasing interest in using machine learning techniques to predict maintenance intervals and improve maintenance performance for railway tracks.
In this project, we will focus on the use of machine learning techniques for predicting maintenance intervals for ballasted railway tracks. we use data that is downloaded from Kaggle. We will review the current state-of-the-art in this field, including the challenges and opportunities for applying machine learning techniques to railway maintenance. We will discuss various machine learning algorithms, data sources, and performance metrics used in previous studies, and present a novel approach for predicting maintenance intervals for ballasted railway tracks using machine learning techniques. This project aims to contribute to the development of more efficient and cost-effective maintenance strategies for railway tracks, improving the safety and reliability of the railway system.
